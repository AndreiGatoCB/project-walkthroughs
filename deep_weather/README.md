# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict the weather using deep learning.  The advantage of deep learning in this context is that it automatically learns a representation of the data - we don't need to do any manual feature engineering.  It can also scale to multiple time series (think data from adjacent weather stations) easily.

By the end, we'll have a deep learning model that predicts the weather, and is able to be extended.

**Project Steps**
* Load in and clean data
* Define targets and predictors
* Train neural network
